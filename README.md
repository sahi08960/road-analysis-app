# 🚦 Road Accident Severity Predictor

A **Machine Learning + Explainable AI** project to predict the **severity of road accidents** (*Slight, Serious, Fatal*).  
Built with **XGBoost**, **Streamlit**, **SHAP**, and **LIME** for explainability.  

---

## 📊 Features
- Predicts **accident severity** based on accident details (weather, light, vehicles, casualties, etc.)
- **Global Explainability** with SHAP (feature importance, beeswarm plots)
- **Local Explainability** with LIME (why a single prediction was made)
- Interactive **Streamlit web app** with input form + dashboard
- Deployable in real-time (Streamlit Cloud)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Numpy  
- XGBoost (ML model)  
- Streamlit (Web app framework)  
- SHAP & LIME (Explainability)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
